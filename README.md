# Toph's Wonder
This Crusader Kings 2 mod creates a few changes pertaining to the Wonders system, enabling them to be extended and interacted with a little more. More may be added later as ideas come.

## Destroy Wonder
This title decision enables an inpedendent ruler to destroy a wonder with the realm. The wonder must be at a point where it can no longer be looted, and the ruler must have full control of the province which contains the wonder. Costs 500 prestige.

## Add Wonder Upgrade Slot
The vanilla ambition *Build a Great Work* will grant an extra Wonder upgrade slot, but is nearly impossible to complete. It's not selectable once you start building a Great Work or once a Great Work has been built. So once it's started, if your ruler doesn't last the 40 years to bring one to Stage two, you're just out of luck.

It's probably for game balance reasons, but there's no reason the ruler should not be able to add further upgrade slots. Did they run out of room? With this decision, the ruler may instead use wealth to directly add an additional upgrade slot on a wonder. The wonder must be built to at least stage four, and the ruler must have total control of the province which contains the wonder. Costs between 1000 and 2000 gold.
