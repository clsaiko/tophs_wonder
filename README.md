# Toph's Wonder
This Crusader Kings 2 mod creates a few changes pertaining to the Wonders system, enabling them to be extended and interacted with a little more. More may be added later as ideas come.

## Destroy Wonder
This title decision enables an inpedendent ruler to destroy a wonder with the realm. The wonder must be at a point where it can no longer be looted, and the ruler must have full control of the province which contains the wonder.

## Add Wonder Upgrade Slot
Instead of trying to use the Construct Wonder ambition, to get an extra upgrade slot (it's non-repeatable, and almost impossible), the ruler may instead use wealth to directly add an additional upgrade slot on a wonder. The wonder must be built to at least stage four, and the ruler must have total control of the province which contains the wonder.
